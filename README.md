# Useful-Java-Utilities

These are very simple utilites I use in some of my projects, I just can't always remember them haha.

Feel free to use any of these, you do not need to credit me at all.

Some of these are things I found online so if you see something here I should have credited please let me know. :)

If you want to add something here for somme reason you can pull request. <3

I try to keep everything as a single class that can be called from other classes (duh).
